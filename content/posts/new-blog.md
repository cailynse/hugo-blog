Spoiler we already bought the property and own it. As expected I am late starting to write about the adventure. Between finishing univerity and starting full time at work I have been enjoying the new routine and taking some time to relax before diving into new projects. I am starting now though, and will do my best to capture the experience thus far.

Toby and I have always known we wanted to build our own house down the line. We expected that it wouldn't really be possible for another 5-10 years due to our jobs and trying to find the perfect property. So when the pandemic hit and we both found ourselved working from home for the forseeable future we jumped at the chance to start looking for property. 

- toby built an app

- cailyn fell in love with the first result

- we panic looked at a handful of properties in the area

- pulled the trigger
